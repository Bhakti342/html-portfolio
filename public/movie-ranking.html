<h1>The Best Movies According to Me!! (Bhakti)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>I really liked this movies, after seeing this movie I cannot relate to what is real and what is not. I will definetly
    recommend it.</p>
<h3>Five-feet Apart</h3>
<p>It made me crying, seeing all the things taht has happend to different characters and the fact that this movie's
    romeo and juliet cannot be near five-feet of distance made me sad and cry even more. I really love this movie</p>
<h3>Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani</h3>
<p> I could be wrong with the spelling but ek toh bollywood movie honi he thi. I liked both Naina and Kabir, how both
    the characters were pursuing their dream that was really great. I do mean carrier wise and in the end they decide to
    be together, that was great too. It's also where the travelling to manali dream begins, and thta dream is not
    limited to traveeling to manali only you know.</p>
